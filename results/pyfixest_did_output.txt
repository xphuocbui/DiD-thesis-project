  95% CI: [-0.058013, -0.007499]
  
Interpretation: The most robust specification (with both time and province 
fixed effects plus clustered standard errors) shows the 2013 education reform 
DECREASED secondary school success probability by 3.28 percentage points.

================================================================================

INTERPRETATION & POLICY IMPLICATIONS
------------------------------------

The most credible estimate (Model 4) suggests that Vietnam's 2013 education 
reform (Reform 29) had a NEGATIVE impact on secondary school success rates:

• Effect Size: -3.28 percentage points decrease in secondary success probability
• Statistical Significance: Significant at 5% level (p = 0.014)  
• Confidence Interval: [-5.80%, -0.75%] percentage points
• Robustness: Result holds with clustered standard errors and full controls

POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS:
1. Transition costs: Reform implementation may have temporarily disrupted 
   educational pathways for the treated cohort
2. Curriculum changes: New educational content/methods may have initially 
   reduced academic performance
3. Resource constraints: Reform rollout may have strained educational resources
4. Adaptation period: Benefits of reform may materialize in later outcomes
   not captured in this analysis

CAVEATS:
- Analysis focuses on secondary school transition, not ultimate educational 
  attainment
- Long-term effects may differ from short-term impacts measured here
- Results specific to cohorts experiencing reform during primary school years
